    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="about">
      Mahendra Singh Dhoni (About this soundpronunciation (helpÂ·info) born 7
      July 1981), is an Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian
      national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test
      cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is the only captain in the history of
      Cricket to win all ICC trophies. Under his captaincy, India won the 2007
      ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket
      World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order
      batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One
      Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is
      considered an effective "finisher" in limited-overs formats.[2][3][4] He
      is also regarded by some as one of the best wicket-keepers and captains in
      modern limited-overs international cricket.
